This directory contains files of RPI_OS_Setup.md and IOT_Platform_Install.md and also the laptop and router information.
The RPI_OS_Setup.md file includes the description about how the dietpi raspberry is installed and also the screenshots of main login sessions.
IOT_Platform_Install.md includes the details about IOT platform installation and about the downloads of MQTT,Node-RED and also PostgreSQl.
In this we open a Node-RED and pull the nodes named as trigger,debug,Postgres and template.
This is what done in 2 files.
For completion of these two installations we need raspberry pi,router and cables.
